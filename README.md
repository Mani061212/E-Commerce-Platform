This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-ecommerce-app.git
cd my-ecommerce-app



Install dependencies:
npm install
This will install all required dependencies and devDependencies, including tailwindcss@^3.x.x, postcss@latest, and autoprefixer@latest.

Initialize Tailwind CSS (if not already done by create-next-app):

npx tailwindcss init -p
This command creates tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js in your project root.

API Reference
This application uses the Fake Store API for product data.

Base URL: https://fakestoreapi.com

Endpoints used:
/products: To fetch all products.
/products/{id}: To fetch a single product by its ID.

Images are configured to be optimized by Next.js from fakestoreapi.com via next.config.js.



UI/UX Enhancements

The application incorporates various Tailwind CSS classes for an improved user experience, including:

Enhanced Shadows & Borders: Provides depth and visual separation.
Smooth Transitions & Hover Effects: Subtle animations on interactive elements for a dynamic feel.
Responsive Adjustments: Uses Tailwind's responsive utilities (md:, lg:) for optimal viewing across devices.
Dark Mode: A user-toggleable dark theme for comfortable Browse.
Subtle Animations: A small bounce animation on the cart icon when items are added.
Clear Quantity Controls: Refined input fields and buttons for cart item quantities.



Here are some ideas for extending this application:

User Authentication: Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
Order History: Allow logged-in users to view their past orders.
Payment Gateway Integration: Connect with a real payment processing service (e.g., Stripe) for actual transactions.
Product Reviews & Ratings: Enable users to leave reviews and display average ratings.
Wishlist: Allow users to save products to a personal wishlist.
Pagination/Infinite Scroll: Implement advanced loading for large product catalogs.
Admin Dashboard: Create a separate interface for managing products, orders, and users.
